Description: Easily perform a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the cost and carbon, ecological, and water footprints of a set of ideal diets. Pre-processing tools are also available to quickly treat the data, along with basic statistical features to analyze the simulation results â€” including the ability to establish confidence intervals for selected parameters, such as nutrients and price/emissions. A 'standard version' of the datasets employed is included as well, allowing users easy access to customization. This package brings the Python software initially developed by Vandevijvere et al. (2018) <doi:10.1186/s12966-018-0648-6> to R.
